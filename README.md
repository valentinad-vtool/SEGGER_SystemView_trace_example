# SEGGER SystemView recording examples repository
Currently available examples for NXP MIMXrt1170 evaluation board and ST nucleo-f413zh board.

## Running examples:
1. Clone git repository *SEGGER_SystemView_trace_example*
2. Load example project in used IDE of your chose(I used NXP MCUXpresso IDE and for ST microcontrollers STM32CubeIDE). This can be done in IDE by clicking on *File->Import->Project from Folder or Archive*.
3. Build project and run it in debug mode.

## Steps to configure SEGGER SystemView recording capabilities for other boards:
In every example project built for specific board you can find README.md file. Follow the instruction and you will successfully run SEGGER SystemView library with FreeRTOS(or some other OS) and your desired microcontroller.
